# DataMiningAndTensorFlow
These are my codebases, I wrote for course project and self learning purpose. most of them are focus on my big interest data mining and machine learming
There are n=4 floder under this repo currently
  for i in range(4):
    0: DataMining 
      -basic data mining concepts implemented using python and R and there are pdf report about the findings
    1: TensorFlow
      -those are codes I wrote during a class Nerual Network with Dr. Simone Ludwig. wjile I was playing with TensorFlow
    2: Kaggele
      -I wrote those code for the kaggle Titanic Passagers prediction competetion using TenorFlow
    3: DataStructureAndAlgorithim
      - self teaching and working on different programming interview challenges codebase
